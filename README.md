# InscryptionLongHaulMod
Tweaks, features and bugfixes to make the game harder. This mod is highly configurable - if you don't like a feature, disable it.

## Modules

This mod is split into seperate modules that can be enabled/disabled in the config.

### Trader Fix Module
This module will force cards with the rare card background to be rare cards and not appear in choice nodes. It will also prevent rare cards from being sold for wolf pelts or lower. The ignorelist can be used to make this module ignore certain cards. (This is less of a bug and more user error; this issue occurs when a card's metadata is setup improperly).

### Boss Module
Makes bosses more difficult. Does the following things:
* Adds a new card called the Queen Bee. The Queen Bee is a rare 2-blood, 3/3 card with Airborne and Sentry sigils.
* Leshy will spawn Queen Bees in unopposed spaces on his side of the board at the beginning of phase 2 of his fight.
* During phase 2 of his fight, the Trapper/Trader will offer rare cards for sale as well as the normal cards he usually provides.
* These rare cards cost Golden Pelts to purchase.
